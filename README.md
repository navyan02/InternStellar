# InternStellar 🚀

InternStellar is a story-driven pixel-art adventure game built in Godot.  
You play as a new NASA intern who oversleeps on her first day—only to arrive at the office and discover that her entire research team has mysteriously vanished after working on a classified alien investigation. It’s now up to you to explore, solve puzzles, uncover clues, and figure out what really happened.
